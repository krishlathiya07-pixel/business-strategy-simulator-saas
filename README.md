# 🏢 Business Simulator

> An **OpenEnv-compliant** real-world environment where an AI agent acts as CEO, making quarterly strategic decisions to grow a company. Features stochastic market dynamics and multi-objective reward optimization.

Built for the **OpenEnv Hackathon — Round 1** · [Live Dashboard](https://ihere04u-business-simulator.hf.space) · [Live API Docs](https://ihere04u-business-simulator.hf.space/docs)

## 🌍 Why This Environment?

Business strategy is a genuine real-world task — companies live and die by quarterly decisions on hiring, marketing, pricing, and R&D. This environment models those decisions with:

- **Stochastic market dynamics** — random noise simulates real market unpredictability
- **Interdependent state variables** — actions have cascading effects (e.g. cutting costs reduces quality, reducing satisfaction, reducing market share)
- **Multi-objective trade-offs** — agents must balance short-term profit vs long-term growth
- **Partial progress rewards** — dense reward signal every quarter, not just at episode end

## 🎯 Tasks

| Task | Difficulty | Goal | Max Quarters | Reward Formula |
|------|-----------|------|-------------|----------------|
| `survive` | Easy | Keep profit > 0 every quarter | 4 | `profitable_quarters / total_quarters` |
| `grow_market_share` | Medium | Reach 20% market share | 8 | `min(market_share / 0.20, 1.0)` + early bonus |
| `scale_profitably` | Hard | 2x revenue AND satisfaction ≥ 0.8 | 12 | `0.6 × revenue_score + 0.4 × satisfaction_score` |

---

## 🔧 Action Space

10 strategic actions, each with an optional `amount` parameter (default: $5,000):

| Action | Primary Effect |
|--------|----------------|
| `increase_marketing` | ↑ Market share, ↑ Satisfaction, ↑ Costs |
| `decrease_marketing` | ↓ Costs, ↓ Market share |
| `hire_employees` | ↑ Revenue capacity, ↑ Costs |
| `layoff_employees` | ↓ Costs, ↓ Satisfaction |
| `cut_costs` | ↓ Costs, ↓ Product quality |
| `invest_in_rd` | ↑ Product quality, ↑ Costs |
| `launch_product` | ↑ Revenue, ↑ Market share |
| `expand_market` | ↑ Market share, ↑ Revenue |
| `raise_prices` | ↑ Revenue, ↓ Satisfaction, ↓ Market share |
| `lower_prices` | ↓ Revenue, ↑ Satisfaction, ↑ Market share |

## 📡 API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/` | Business Simulator Dashboard UI — interactive web interface with live charts, competitor comparison, and simulation controls |
| `GET` | `/health` | Health check — returns `{"status": "healthy"}` |
| `GET` | `/metadata` | Environment metadata |
| `GET` | `/schema` | Typed action/observation/state schemas |
| `POST` | `/reset` | Reset environment for a task |
| `POST` | `/step` | Take an action, advance one quarter |
| `GET` | `/state` | Get current state |
| `GET` | `/tasks` | List all tasks + action schema |
| `POST` | `/grader` | Grade a completed episode |
| `GET` | `/baseline` | Run rule-based baseline on all 3 tasks |
| `POST` | `/mcp` | MCP JSON-RPC endpoint |

## 🏆 Reward Design

All rewards are **partial progress signals** — no sparse binary end-of-episode rewards:

- **survive**: `profitable_quarters / total_quarters` — scores every quarter
- **grow_market_share**: `min(final_share / 0.20, 1.0)` + early completion bonus
- **scale_profitably**: `0.6 × revenue_score + 0.4 × satisfaction_score` — weighted multi-objective

Undesirable behaviors are penalized:
- Bankruptcy (profit < -$50,000) → early termination
- Over-hiring with no revenue → costs spiral punishes poor decisions
- Cutting costs repeatedly → product quality degrades, reducing future revenue

---

## 📊 Baseline Scores

Scores from the included rule-based baseline agent (`baseline.py`):

| Task | Score | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| `survive` | 1.000 | Profitable all 4 quarters |
| `grow_market_share` | 1.000 | Reached 30% (target: 20%) |
| `scale_profitably` | 0.890 | Revenue $81K, satisfaction 0.82 |

### Inference (LLM Agent)

```bash
export HF_TOKEN=your_token
export MODEL_NAME=Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct

## 📋 Quick Example

```python
import requests

BASE = "https://ihere04u-business-simulator.hf.space"

# Reset
state = requests.post(f"{BASE}/reset", json={"task": "survive", "seed": 42}).json()

# Play 4 quarters
for _ in range(4):
    state = requests.post(f"{BASE}/step", json={
        "task": "survive",
        "action": "increase_marketing",
        "amount": 5000
    }).json()
    print(state["message"], "| Reward:", state["reward"])

# Grade
score = requests.post(f"{BASE}/grader", json={"task": "survive"}).json()
print("Final score:", score["score"])
```
